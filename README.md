### Hi there 👋, I'm Chen

- 🔭 I’m currently a master's student at Columbia Engineering, majoring in Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for a summer 2023 Software Engineering Intern in the US.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: My motivation for studying computer science comes from an anime called Sword Art Online, and I hope that one day full immersion in virtual reality can be realized.
